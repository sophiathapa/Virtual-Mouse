# Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse

A computer-vision powered virtual mouse system that uses hand gestures to control mouse movements, clicks, and interactions removing the need for a physical mouse. Built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, this project demonstrates the use of real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
## 🚀 Features

- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe

- Cursor control based on index finger position

- Left click, right click, drag and drop gestures

- Smooth cursor movement with stabilization

- Works with any webcam

- Lightweight and fast (runs on CPU)

  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, NumPy, Tenserflow
- **Tools**: Webcam, Virtual Environment (optional)
